    <h2><strong>Why is Christmas Special in the Philippines? 🎁</strong></h2>
    <p>
        The Philippines is known for having the <b>longest Christmas season in the world</b>!
        As soon as the <b>"Ber months" (September, October, November, December)</b> begin,
        Filipinos start playing Christmas carols, setting up decorations, and preparing for the grandest holiday of the year.

        On Christmas Day, families visit their relatives, exchange gifts, and give <strong>aguinaldo (cash gifts)</strong> to children.
        Many also take this time to reflect on the <b>spiritual meaning of Christmas</b>, attending church services and helping those in need.

    <h3><b>🎊 What Makes a Filipino Christmas Special?</b></h3>
    <p>
        <b>Filipino Christmas is all about family, faith, and festivity.</b> Unlike in other countries where Christmas is a single-day event,
        in the Philippines, it is a <strong>season of giving, love, and gratitude</strong>. Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs)
        make it a priority to come home, making the holiday even more meaningful.
